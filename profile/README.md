# LOFAR-VLBI

This is the organisation homepage for LOFAR-VLBI. Here you can find all the relevant repositiories to run the VLBI pipeline. 

We are an active group of people with the common goal of processing LOFAR data to produce sub-arcsecond resolution images. The group holds regular telecons every two weeks and hosts busy weeks twice per year (one in person and one online). It is a welcoming group particularly for early career researchers and a great way to learn about processing LOFAR data at high resolution. We also have a Slack workspace for informal discussions or troubleshooting. The working group is also responsible for the high-resolution aspect of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey. If you are interested in joining, please let the current chair know - Leah Morabito (leah.k.morabito) @ (durham.ac.uk)

Documentation on how to run each section of the pipeline can be found in the wiki of each repository. However, the main place to look is within the [lofar-vlbi-pipeline](https://github.com/LOFAR-VLBI/lofar-vlbi-pipeline) repository. Specifically, the [wiki within that repository](https://github.com/LOFAR-VLBI/lofar-vlbi-pipeline/wiki).
