# LOFAR-VLBI

This is the organisation homepage for LOFAR-VLBI. Here you can find all the relevant repositiories to run the VLBI pipeline. 

Documentation on how to run each section of the pipeline can be found in the wiki of each repository. However, the main place to look is within the [lofar-vlbi-pipeline](https://github.com/LOFAR-VLBI/lofar-vlbi-pipeline) repository.
